\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
It doesn't make sense because the validation set is small and the estimate of the test error using such a small validation set is highly variable.
    \item
It is possible to overfit if we have a small dataset and we use LOOCV.
    \item
LOOCV gives approximately unbiased predictions of the test error because each model uses almost the full data set,
k-fold uses a smaller set to train the models, but still leads to preditions with an intermediate level of bias (higher than LOOCV but much lower than set validation)
