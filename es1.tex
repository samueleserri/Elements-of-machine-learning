1. ?? it doesn't make sense because set validation leads to an overestimation of the test error.

2. 

3. LOOCV gives approximately unbiased predictions of the test error because each model uses almost the full data set,
k-fold uses a smaller set to train the models, but still leads to preditions with an intermediate level of bias (higher than LOOCV but much lower than set validation)


bruttacopia
the models fitted with LOOCV are very similar and highly correlated with eachother, whereas k-fold CV results in much more varied preditions.
therefore test error estimates resulting from LOOCV have much higher variance than k-fold CV
